# rCHIP-8

A CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator written in Rust. Currently the interpreter only
runs on UNIX terminals because of the method used to control the display.

## Running

The emulator is built and run as normal using Cargo. The executable takes one
mandatory argument which is the path to the ROM file to run.
